/**
 * @quizzme/ui - Reusable UI Components
 *
 * This package provides shared React components for the QuizzMe platform.
 * Components should be presentation-only and receive data via props.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE NOTE:
 * - UI components should NOT import domain logic directly
 * - Use api-contracts for shared type definitions
 * - Domain logic should be passed as props or callbacks
